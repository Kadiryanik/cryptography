## Visual Cryptography Demo

You can generate the 1.bmp and 2.bmp files with following commands.

```sh
$ cd steganography
$ make
$ ./test.out -b images/backup/lena256x256.bmp
$ ./test.out -v images/binary.bmp
```

This will give you 1.bmp and 2.bmp files. Then you can open the html file on your browser. For the manuel movement, you can use div-position-manuel.js.
